            <h2>Grocery stores: Should we only give in-kind aid, such as food, water, or gift cards, which cannot be misused?</h2>

            <p>Previously, we discussed how giving in-kind aid is wiser, as it prevents harmful item purchases (e.g., alcohol and drugs). It's a win-win when someone asks for it, but should we refuse monetary requests and only offer in-kind aid, especially if grocery or convenience stores are nearby?</p>

            <p>Kant's imperfect duty to give doesn't require us to always give or always give money. But it does require that we treat beggars with respect. It includes recognizing the recipient's capacity to decide what best meets their needs. When you give in-kind aid instead of cash to avoid misuse and promote what you think is better for them, you undermine their agency, which Kant would see as morally problematic.
                Stohr, K. (2011). Kantian Beneficence and the Problem of Obligatory Aid. Journal of Moral Philosophy, 8(1), 45–67.
                (Some could challenge that Kant doesn't require us to treat those who've lost rationality as moral agents. That's partly true. For permanently irrational beings (e.g., those with severe mental illness), Kant says we owe them kindness, not moral duties. Though if it's temporary (e.g., intoxication, drug usage), Kant advises withholding moral judgment until they regain rationality).</p>

            <p>Effective altruists would simply extend their earlier analysis: direct aid, whether cash or in-kind, remains suboptimal compared to systematic solutions through effective organizations, which could provide addiction treatment, housing, or some sort of care for the most needy.</p>

            <p>To reiterate, a Buddhist ethicist would give with goodwill, detached from potential outcomes. So while giving only in-kind aid to prevent harm is still an act of generosity, a more mindful approach involves offering a choice: "Would you prefer some food or would money be more helpful?" This honors the recipient's agency while demonstrating awareness of their immediate needs. The Buddhist principle of dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda) reminds us that homelessness and addiction arise from complex conditions, not simply individual choices.

                Consequently, while offering immediate aid in whatever form suits the situation, Buddhists would also emphasize addressing systemic causes through community action and policy change.</p>
