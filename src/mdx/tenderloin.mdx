## Ethical dilemmas when giving might enable harm

### Are we morally obligated to give if our aid might enable harmful behaviors?

<EthicalPerspective type="kant" title="Kantian Perspective">
  Kant would assert that you still have the imperfect duty to give. As Stohr (2011) explains, 
  the moral rightness of an action depends on whether it could be universalized to be a moral law, 
  independently of its predicted effects. Concerns that "aid might enable harm" are subjective and 
  lack the universality needed for a moral duty.

<EthicalPerspective type="util" title="Utilitarian Approach">
  A utilitarian approach considers whether the aid likely improves or worsens overall well-being. 
  If giving is likely to result in harmful outcomes such as fostering addiction, it could decrease 
  overall well-being and might be considered morally wrong, as described in Beauchamp's (2008) 
  analysis of beneficence.

<EthicalPerspective type="buddha" title="Buddhist View">
  Buddhist texts on giving (dāna) from the Aṅguttaranikāya suggest that giving generates good merit 
  even if the recipient misuses the aid. However, Buddhist ethics also value wisdom. If giving directly 
  enables harm, a more discerning act of compassion might be needed.
