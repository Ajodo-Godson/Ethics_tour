## In-kind aid vs. monetary assistance

### Should we only give in-kind aid, such as food, water or health kits, which cannot be misused?

<EthicalPerspective type="kant" title="Kantian Perspective">
  From a Kantian lens, when you give only in-kind aid, are you treating the recipient as a fellow 
  rational being, or are you subtly asserting superiority in deciding what they should want? 
  Kant would caution against paternalism while still acknowledging your imperfect duty to help.

<EthicalPerspective type="util" title="Utilitarian Approach">
  Effective altruists would approach this pragmatically: Which form of giving produces the most 
  positive impact? Studies suggest direct cash aid often improves outcomes, but context matters. 
  Giving a sandwich to someone who is clearly hungry may yield immediate utility.

<EthicalPerspective type="buddha" title="Buddhist View">
  Buddhist ethics would focus on whether your action reduces suffering while maintaining compassion, 
  acknowledging that intention shapes the moral quality of giving.
