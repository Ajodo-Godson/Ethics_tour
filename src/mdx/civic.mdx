### Are we shifting the burden of addressing homelessness and poverty from public institutions onto individual donors, thereby normalizing systemic failure?

<EthicalPerspective type="kant" title="Kantian Perspective">
  Kant might question whether we're giving from genuine duty or merely to appear virtuous in this 
  public setting. The moral worth of an action comes from acting from duty, not from inclination 
  or social pressure.
</EthicalPerspective>

<EthicalPerspective type="util" title="Utilitarian Approach">
  Utilitarians would consider the broader implications. Does public giving create positive awareness 
  or potentially negative consequences like disputes over resources?
</EthicalPerspective>

<EthicalPerspective type="buddha" title="Buddhist View">
  Buddhist ethics reminds us that our intentions matter - giving publicly with genuine compassion 
  differs from giving for social recognition. Yet all beings deserve support regardless of where 
  they're encountered.
