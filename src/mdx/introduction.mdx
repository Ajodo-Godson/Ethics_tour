# Introduction

## Should you give to beggars when it might enable harm? A San Francisco Ethics Tour

You're walking down a bustling San Francisco street when a stranger approaches you for aid, cash or in-kind. You scan the details: rumpled jacket, torn sneakers, matted hair, an odor that speaks of nights spent outdoors. Their eyes lock onto yours, flickers of hope and hesitation blending in a silent plea. They are probably one in thousands of individuals without permanent housing in this city. In that heartbeat, you're asked to decide: will you reach into your pocket?

Broadly speaking, there are two perspectives on this scenario. The sympathetic views panhandling as a way for destitute people to fulfill their basic needs, an opportunity for the more fortunate to help, and an indicator of systemic failure to provide and care for those in need. The unsympathetic argues that panhandling encourages dependency and funds harmful behaviors like addiction, undermining individual responsibility and social order. And while peaceful handling is legally permissible in the US, aggressive panhandling, such as obstructing, following, or intimidating others into giving, is illegal under California's law.   

What are the morally right things to do? As we walk through San Francisco's neighborhoods, we'll explore how different ethical frameworks might guide our actions in response to panhandling.
